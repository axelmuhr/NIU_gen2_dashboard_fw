# NIU 2nd generation dashboard firmware 
This is the Disassembly of the 2nd generation dashboard firmware from a NIU N1s aka NQi electric scooter (starting with model year 2018+)
A label on the back of the case says "N1SPv20" and the firmware seems to be revision _NSHDBV04_

# Hardware
Besides the LCD, a buck-converter and RS485 receiver the dashboard contains an STM32F0308T6 32-bit micro controller from STmicro.

That's an ARM CortexÂ®-M0 core and run at speeds up to 48 MHz having 64k of flash and 8k of RAM.
Aditionally there are two USARTs, two SPI and two I2C controllers built in.

# Code
This is the "first shot" at the disassembly mainly adding labels to the known addresses (e.g. USART1_base) hinting towards the functionality of those functions which are using them.
